| Ben Graham | NEUTRAL  |        65.0% | A careful examination of Apple Inc. reveals a decidedly      |
|            |          |              | mixed picture, leading to a neutral recommendation. While    |
|            |          |              | the company demonstrates a positive earnings history with    |
|            |          |              | consistent profitability—a commendable trait—its financial   |
|            |          |              | strength and valuation present significant concerns. The     |
|            |          |              | consistent positive Earnings Per Share is encouraging,       |
|            |          |              | though the rate of growth is not the primary consideration   |
|            |          |              | in our approach. However, a current ratio of 0.87 is         |
|            |          |              | demonstrably weak and falls far short of the 2.0 threshold I |
|            |          |              | would require for comfortable investment. This indicates a   |
|            |          |              | precarious liquidity position, leaving the company           |
|            |          |              | vulnerable to short-term financial stress. Furthermore, a    |
|            |          |              | debt ratio of 0.84 is quite high, exceeding prudent levels.  |
|            |          |              | I generally prefer to see debt-to-equity ratios below 0.5,   |
|            |          |              | and this figure suggests significant leverage. Turning to    |
|            |          |              | valuation, the calculated Graham Number arrives at $22.59.   |
|            |          |              | The current market price trading considerably *above* this   |
|            |          |              | figure, resulting in a margin of safety of -89.06%,          |
|            |          |              | effectively eliminates any buffer against unforeseen         |
|            |          |              | difficulties. A true margin of safety—buying substantially   |
|            |          |              | below intrinsic value—is paramount for prudent investing.    |
|            |          |              | While the dividend history provides a small measure of       |
|            |          |              | reassurance, it is insufficient to offset the deficiencies   |
|            |          |              | in liquidity, leverage, and valuation. Therefore, despite    |
|            |          |              | the consistent earnings, the absence of a margin of safety   |
|            |          |              | and the weak financial position compels a neutral stance.    |
|            |          |              | The company is not demonstrably unsound, but neither does it |
|            |          |              | offer the requisite characteristics for a value investor.    |

| Ben Graham | NEUTRAL  |        65.0% | Our analysis of Alphabet (GOOGL) presents a mixed picture,   |
|            |          |              | leading to a neutral recommendation. While the company       |
|            |          |              | demonstrates positive earnings per share with consistent     |
|            |          |              | growth over the analyzed periods, its current valuation does |
|            |          |              | not provide a sufficient margin of safety according to my    |
|            |          |              | principles. The calculated Graham Number is $69.70, yet the  |
|            |          |              | current price of $159.22 represents a -56.22% margin of      |
|            |          |              | safety – entirely inadequate. A truly safe investment        |
|            |          |              | requires a substantial discount to intrinsic value. On a     |
|            |          |              | more positive note, the company exhibits reasonable          |
|            |          |              | financial strength. The current ratio of 1.84, while not     |
|            |          |              | exceptionally high, exceeds my minimum requirement of 2.0.   |
|            |          |              | However, it is still a moderate value. Furthermore, the debt |
|            |          |              | ratio of 0.28 is quite conservative, indicating a prudent    |
|            |          |              | approach to leverage—comfortably below the 0.50 threshold I  |
|            |          |              | prefer. The company’s history of intermittent dividend       |
|            |          |              | payments adds a small degree of safety, but consistent       |
|            |          |              | dividends would be preferable. In summary, while GOOGL is a  |
|            |          |              | profitable and conservatively financed enterprise, the       |
|            |          |              | current price offers no margin of safety. Therefore, I       |
|            |          |              | cannot recommend this investment at this time, even though   |
|            |          |              | it has acceptable financial metrics.                         |

| Ben Graham | NEUTRAL  |        65.0% | Our analysis of Microsoft indicates a neutral stance. While  |
|            |          |              | the company demonstrates consistent earnings – Earnings Per  |
|            |          |              | Share were positive across all periods and exhibited growth  |
|            |          |              | – its financial strength and valuation present concerns. The |
|            |          |              | current ratio of 1.27, while not alarming, falls short of    |
|            |          |              | the 1.5 threshold I deem prudent for sufficient liquidity.   |
|            |          |              | Fortunately, the debt ratio of 0.48 is conservative,         |
|            |          |              | residing below my preferred limit of 0.50, and the company   |
|            |          |              | maintains a history of dividend payments, adding a degree of |
|            |          |              | safety. However, the most significant detractor is the       |
|            |          |              | valuation. Our calculation yields a Graham Number of $98.19. |
|            |          |              | The current price, while not drastically inflated, offers a  |
|            |          |              | limited margin of safety, with a negative margin of safety   |
|            |          |              | of -74.90%. Without a substantial discount to the Graham     |
|            |          |              | Number, I cannot recommend purchase. While not a wholly      |
|            |          |              | unfavorable entity, Microsoft currently does not meet the    |
|            |          |              | rigorous criteria for a compelling investment based on my    |
|            |          |              | principles.                                                  |

| Ben Graham | NEUTRAL  |        65.0% | Our analysis of NVIDIA reveals a company with sound          |
|            |          |              | financial strength, but regrettably, a lack of discernible   |
|            |          |              | margin of safety. The current ratio of 4.44 is commendable,  |
|            |          |              | exceeding my preferred threshold of 2.0, and the debt ratio  |
|            |          |              | of 0.29 is conservatively low. Furthermore, consistent       |
|            |          |              | earnings and a history of dividend payments offer a degree   |
|            |          |              | of reassurance. However, the critical flaw lies in the       |
|            |          |              | valuation. While NVIDIA demonstrates a Net Current Asset     |
|            |          |              | Value of $47.852 billion, this translates to a mere $1.95    |
|            |          |              | per share. The calculated Graham Number of $14.69 is         |
|            |          |              | insufficient to provide a margin of safety given the current |
|            |          |              | share price of $108.33, resulting in a substantial -86.44%   |
|            |          |              | discrepancy. Although the company exhibits operational       |
|            |          |              | strengths, a prudent investor requires a meaningful discount |
|            |          |              | to intrinsic value, which is demonstrably absent in this     |
|            |          |              | case. Consequently, we maintain a neutral stance.            |

|            |          |              | While the company demonstrates a Current Ratio of 2.02,      |
|            |          |              | meeting my minimum threshold for liquidity, this is          |
|            |          |              | overshadowed by significant concerns regarding profitability |
|            |          |              | and valuation. Earnings per share were negative in multiple  |
|            |          |              | periods, a clear indication of instability and a lack of     |
|            |          |              | consistent performance. Furthermore, the Price per Share of  |
|            |          |              | $280.26 is drastically elevated when compared to our         |
|            |          |              | calculated Graham Number of $33.83, representing a           |
|            |          |              | substantial absence of margin of safety – a negative 87.93%. |
|            |          |              | The Net Current Asset Value per share is a mere $3.11,       |
|            |          |              | providing no tangible asset backing for the current market   |
|            |          |              | price. The absence of dividend payments, while not a primary |
|            |          |              | condemnation, further underscores the lack of commitment to  |
|            |          |              | shareholder returns. Based on these findings, I cannot       |
|            |          |              | recommend an investment in Tesla at this time; prudence      |
